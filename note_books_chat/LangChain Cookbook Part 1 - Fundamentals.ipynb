    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~~TL~~DR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Update Oct '23: This notebook has been expanded from it's original form*\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need an OpenAI api key to follow this tutorial. You can have it as an environement variable, in an .env file where this jupyter notebook lives, or insert it below where 'YourAPIKey' is. Have if you have questions on this, put these instructions into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)."

      "\" President Biden addressed the American people from the Capitol steps, gathering together Democrats, Republicans, and Independents as one nation. He underscored their shared duty to the people, Constitution, and resolve that freedom will always prevail over tyranny. He reminded all that six days ago, Vladimir Putin attempted to weaken the free world, but was met with unwavering strength.\n",
      "\n",
      " When an outside force attempted to invade Ukraine, they were met with tremendous courage from the Ukrainian people, demonstrated by citizens blocking tanks with their bodies and citizens from all walks of life defending their homeland. In this struggle, as President Zelenskyy expressed in a speech, light will prevail. Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States was also present.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is imploring the audience to stand and demonstrate that the United States stands with Ukraine, as failure to hold dictators accountable for aggression leads to greater chaos in the world. Additionally, they note the importance of the NATO Alliance in providing peace and stability in Europe and that American diplomacy and resolve are of utmost importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, rejecting diplomacy and assuming the West and NATO would not respond. However, the West was ready and responded swiftly by preparing extensively and building an international coalition of other freedom-loving nations to confront Putin. The West also sought to counter Russia's lies with truth.\n",
      "\n",
      " In response to Russia's lies, the international community has held them accountable, enforcing powerful economic sanctions. 27 European Union countries, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, and other countries have come together in an effort to decrease Russia's isolation from the world by cutting off their largest banks from the international financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      " The United States is working with its European allies to weaken Russian military strength, cut off its access to technology, and take away the wealth of those responsible for abuses of power. The U.S. Department of Justice is creating a task force to seize assets like yachts, luxury apartments, and private jets of Russian oligarchs.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In response to Russian actions, the US and its allies have announced a complete ban on Russian air travel in American airspace, temporarily suspending Russia's stock market trading, and providing financial, military, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine totaling $1 Billion. Due to these measures, the Russian economy is facing significant decline, with the Ruble losing 30% of its value and the stock market 40%. Putin is directly responsible for the economic turmoil.\n",
      "\n",
      " This statement addresses military engagement in Ukraine, noting that US forces will not be engaged in combat there. However, ground, air, and naval forces have been mobilized to defensive NATO allies on the border with Ukraine in case of Russian aggression.\n",
      "\n",
      " The US and Allies will militarily protect any NATO countries, and Ukraine is showing tremendous courage against Russian aggression in the face of certain hardship. However, the Ukraine people have made it clear that they will not tolerate efforts to take them backwards.\n",
      "\n",
      " In response to Russian invasion of a foreign country, President Obama has taken robust action to make sure the pain of sanctions is targeted at Russia's economy. Furthermore, he has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world, with the United States releasing 30 Million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He is also prepared to do more if necessary, with the support of our allies.\n",
      "\n",
      " This speech argues that although the news around Russian aggression in Ukraine may be worrying, the outcome in the long run should benefit the rest of the world financially, leaving Russia weaker. It also highlights the increased unity among world leaders and the large crowds of people from all over the world, including those in Russia, who are voicing their support for Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article is a tribute to the strength of the Ukrainian people and their love of democracy in the face of a hostile adversary. It also serves as a call for the free world to rise up and declare its solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the struggle to protect and preserve democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is an overview of the hard times America has faced over the past two years due to the pandemic, with families struggling with rising costs of living. To help, the President passed the American Rescue Plan, to aid with people struggling due to these difficult times.\n",
      "\n",
      " The American Rescue Plan has been a critical piece of legislation during the COVID-19 crisis, providing economic relief and aiding in vaccination efforts. The plan was designed to benefit working people and it has proven successful in creating jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The economy created an unprecedented 6.5 million jobs in the last year, and grew at the strongest rate in nearly 40 years. This was achieved through providing tax breaks to those at the very top and believing that the benefits would \"trickle down\" to everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      " Vice President Harris and President Biden ran for office with a new economic vision to invest in America, educate its citizens, and grow the workforce to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out, as opposed to the trickle-down theory of the past that led to weak economy growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and a widening gap between the rich and poor. They want to restore America's infrastructure to be the best in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to win the competition of the 21st Century, a bipartisan effort was made to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the most sweeping investment in American history. This will result in an infrastructure decade that will help America remain competitive with the rest of the world, and put them on a path to success.\n",
      "\n",
      " This plan will create millions of American jobs to help deal with the climate crisis through the modernization of infrastructure such as roads, airports, ports, and waterways. It will also focus on tasks such as building electric vehicle charging frames, replacing lead pipes, providing affordable high-speed internet, and announcing 4,000 projects.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Biden has announced a major infrastructure overhaul, which includes fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges, and using taxpayer money to buy American products to support American jobs, in accordance with a law on the books for nearly a century. This law seeks to ensure taxpayer money supports American jobs and businesses, with the current Administration vowing to follow through on this commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      " To compete for the best jobs of the future, Congress needs to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act to make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. An example of why this investment is important can be found in a 1,000 acre plot of land located just east of Columbus, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      " Intel is building a $20 billion mega site with up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. This will create 10,000 new jobs and provide the technology powering the world and everyday lives, like smartphones, the internet, and future inventions.\n",
      "\n",
      " Intel is ready to invest $100 billion in American manufacturing, the biggest investment of its kind in US history. The President calls for the passage of the bill that will make this possible, and emphasizes the positive impact of more American manufacturing. He states that Intel is just one example of a renewal of pride in products \"Made In America\".\n",
      "\n",
      " Companies, such JoJo Burgess' steelworkers from Pittsburgh, are choosing to build new factories in the US rather than overseas, which has led to the creation of 369,000 manufacturing jobs in America last year. Ford and GM have invested a combined $18 billion, creating a total of 15,000 jobs. Senator Sherrod Brown is proposing to bury the 'Rust Belt' label, indicating the US is on the up once again.\n",
      "\n",
      " Although there are signs of economic success like record job growth and higher wages, many families are still struggling due to inflation. The speaker's top priority is to get prices under control, as it has been difficult for businesses to keep up with production and disruptions to global supply chains have caused prices to go up. An example of this was seen with cars.\n",
      "\n",
      " When there weren't enough semiconductors to make cars last year, automobile prices went up. The author suggests an alternative to fighting inflation by driving down wages: increase the productive capacity of the economy by making more cars and semiconductors in America, investing in infrastructure and innovation, and creating more jobs with good wages.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker has a plan to fight inflation and lower costs by reducing the price of prescription drugs; 17 Nobel Laureates in economics support the plan and the speaker has spoken to a family in Virginia that is affected by high costs.\n",
      "\n",
      " Joshua, one of the 200,000 young people with Type 1 diabetes, is here with us tonight to celebrate his birthday. This occasion serves as a reminder to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. Ensuring drug companies still make a profit, while enabling Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA currently does - can help alleviate the devastating situation of being unable to afford medication for a child.\n",
      "\n",
      " The American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families save money on healthcare premiums, and this can be made permanent. Families can also save money on their energy bills with tax credits for weatherizing homes and businesses, increased clean energy production, and lower costs for electric vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      " This plan proposes cutting the cost of child care and other family-related expenses like home and long-term care, affordable housing, and pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old, in order to help middle-class and working families who have been affected by the pandemic. It aims to cut the cost in half for most families so that they no longer have to spend more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\n",
      "\n",
      " In an effort to reform the current unfair tax system, this proposal suggests that no one earning below $400,000 will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Corporations and the wealthiest Americans should pay their fair share according to a 15% minimum tax rate. This will help to balance the system and ensure that corporations are not paying a disproportionately lower rate than individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The speaker has proposed a plan to grow the economy and reduce costs for families by getting more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate in order to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. Additionally, the speaker wants to close loopholes so the wealthy pay the same tax rate as teachers and firefighters, as well as confirm nominees to the Federal Reserve. This plan would reduce costs and the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      " The previous Administration increased the deficit with tax cuts and neglected the watchdogs meant to ensure pandemic relief funds were not mishandled. In the current Administration, those watchdogs have been welcomed back and a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud has been named to prosecute those who theft relief money. By the end of 2021, the deficit will be drastically reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "  President Donald Trump is the only president to have cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. He believes that competition is key to lowering costs and promoting capitalism instead of exploitation which drives up prices. During the pandemic, foreign-owned ocean carriers raised prices by as much as 1,000%, profiting from this unjustifiable increase.\n",
      "\n",
      " In tonight's announcement, a crackdown on companies overcharging consumers and businesses is being implemented. Medicare is setting higher standards for nursing homes to ensure greater quality and cost control. Additionally, workers are being given a fair shot with better training, skill-based hires, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and paid leave.\n",
      "\n",
      " This piece argues that to build a better America, the minimum wage should be increased to $15 an hour, the Child Tax Credit should be extended, Pell Grants should be increased, support of HBCUs should continue to be increased, and community colleges should be invested in. Additionally, the PRO Act should be passed to make it easier for workers to form unions, as it has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two years.\n",
      "\n",
      " The progress made in the fight against COVID-19 has allowed people to move forward and return to more normal routines. Significant progress has been made since July with the CDC recently issuing new guidelines, allowing most Americans in most of the country to be mask free. In the coming weeks more of the country should reach this same level of safety.\n",
      "\n",
      " The progress made this past year has allowed us to not be dominated by COVID-19. Vaccines and treatments are the best way to protect against it and stay on guard. Four common sense steps should be taken to move forward safely.\n",
      "\n",
      " Vaccinations for Americans are continuing, particularly for children under 5. Anti-viral treatments like the Pfizer pill are also being made available, reducing the chance of hospitalization by 90%. The U.S. has ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world, with 1 million expected this month and more than double that in the following month.\n",
      "\n",
      " This initiative - \"Test to Treat\" enables people to get tested at a pharmacy, if found positive, receive antiviral pills directly; immunocompromised people and others with vulnerability will be provided treatments and free masks; and people can order free COVID-19 tests from covidtests.gov starting next week.\n",
      "\n",
      " This plan outlines the steps necessary to prepare for new variants of the virus and to end the shutdown of businesses and schools, including the deployment of new vaccines within 100 days if needed, and the acquisition of new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills if Congress provides the necessary funds.\n",
      "\n",
      " Americans are beginning to return to their workplaces and educational institutions to continue economic and social progress. Most adults are now vaccinated, and the government has provided free tests, treatments, masks, and vaccines to help facilitate safe and healthy reopening. However, continuing this progress does come with a cost.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Biden is preparing to send a financial request to Congress in order to keep aiding the world in vaccine distribution and to prevent further losses due to COVID-19. He has already sent 475 million doses to 112 countries, but he will continue if Congress passes the request. By recognizing COVID-19 as a God-awful disease rather than a partisan issue, Biden hopes to reset and restore a sense of normalcy.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to move forward together on COVID-19 and other issues, Americans should stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who they really are. After visiting the NYPD, the author reflects on the tragic deaths of Officers Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera who were killed in the line of duty. Both were Dominican Americans and had grown up in the same neighbourhood they chose to patrol.\"\n",

      "\" The speaker addressed the families of those lost to violence, professing their eternal gratitude and commitment to restoring trust and safety to communities. They outlined the importance of investing in crime prevention and community police officers in order to achieve these goals while standing against abandoning streets or choosing safety or justice. The speaker concluded by calling for unity in protecting communities, restoring trust, and holding law enforcement accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to promote safety and justice in communities, the Justice Department mandated body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers, and the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion for hiring more police and implementing effective measures such as community violence interruption. The proposed budget is also calling for more funding and increased training for police in order to keep our neighborhoods safe.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to reduce gun violence, the speaker calls on Congress to enact universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repeal the liability shield for gun manufacturers. The speaker states that these measures would not violate the second amendment and would save lives. Finally, they emphasize that the right to vote and have it counted is under assault and needs to be protected.\n",

      "\n",
      " President Biden recently nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

      "\n",

Technology like scanners will be implemented to help detect drug smuggling, joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch human traffickers, and dedicated immigration judges will be put in place to speed up the claims process. The US is also working with partners in South and Central America to secure their borders and provide refuge for people fleeing persecution and violence.\n",
